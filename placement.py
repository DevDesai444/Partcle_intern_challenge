"""
VLSI Cell Placement Optimization Challenge
==========================================

CHALLENGE OVERVIEW:
You are tasked with implementing a critical component of a chip placement optimizer.
Given a set of cells (circuit components) with fixed sizes and connectivity requirements,
you need to find positions for these cells that:
1. Minimize total wirelength (wiring cost between connected pins)
2. Eliminate all overlaps between cells

YOUR TASK:
Implement the `overlap_repulsion_loss()` function to prevent cells from overlapping.
The function must:
- Be differentiable (uses PyTorch operations for gradient descent)
- Detect when cells overlap in 2D space
- Apply increasing penalties for larger overlaps
- Work efficiently with vectorized operations

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
After running the optimizer with your implementation:
- overlap_count should be 0 (no overlapping cell pairs)
- total_overlap_area should be 0.0 (no overlap)
- wirelength should be minimized
- Visualization should show clean, non-overlapping placement

GETTING STARTED:
1. Read through the existing code to understand the data structures
2. Look at wirelength_attraction_loss() as a reference implementation
3. Implement overlap_repulsion_loss() following the TODO instructions
4. Run main() and check the overlap metrics in the output
5. Tune hyperparameters (lambda_overlap, lambda_wirelength) if needed
6. Generate visualization to verify your solution

BONUS CHALLENGES:
- Improve convergence speed by tuning learning rate or adding momentum
- Implement better initial placement strategy
- Add visualization of optimization progress over time
